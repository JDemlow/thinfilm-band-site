    <section class="thoughts">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)">robber barons</a>, mustache twirlers, supermanagers who dodge billions in taxes then pay nominal zedakah and pat themselves on the fatty back for their probity. feudal times with nicer textiles and mass distribution. there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">ways out</a> that we can't even discuss for fear of/lack of imagination about advancing beyond neoliberal capitalistic realism.</p>

<p>with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_despair">no love and early deaths</a> and poor posture. we are approaching <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/give-us-fully-automated-luxury-communism/592099/">near-infinite energy, near-complete automation, and new means of food production at rapidly declining costs</a>, and we can't even take care of our citizens.</p>



<p>and still
here we are, debating the same bullshit about "values" and the "merits of the completely unfettered market" instead of just taking care of people. there is no debate to be had, what is needed is policy change: term limits, majority rule (a democracy, anyone?), jailing those who are "alleged" of obvious crimes (there used to be ethics and morality, and just generally being decent), reduction of military spend as a % of GDP (sure, we need to defend ourselves, but we also need to redistribute in a way that reduces inequity, not pile all our dough into <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/24/the-rise-of-ai-fighter-pilots">AI fighter jets and such</a>), retraining on energy advancements and new technologies, an ounce of prevention, free higher education, universal healthcare (like every other leading nation...), continue and enhance and raise the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-global-minimum-tax-deal-what-will-it-mean-2021-10-08/">the new global tax minimum</a>, and more, obvi.</p>

<p>really
let's use renewable energy and let the last breaths of coal choke itself out (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215790/coal-mining-employment-in-the-us/">there are only 40,000 coal jobs</a>. are you telling me we can't retrain and find BETTER employment for those 40,000 people in a safer, newer industry? another failure of collective imagination).</p>

<p>and still
<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-is-effective-altruism">we need to be better to each other</a>, just by the by, easygoinglike, a passing smile and nod. there's not too many crumbs left, we should put them all together and make a pie, have some bubbly cold duck with it, a cheap cigar, then throw it at those in charge.</p>

<p>so
help your neighbor. put a dollar in the homeless guy's cup. sweep your kitchen. take a breath.</p>
